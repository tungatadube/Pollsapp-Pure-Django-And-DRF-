# Pollsapp-Pure-Django-And-DRF-
Polls app

1. This is a polls app that starts as a pure Django app
  - we build views using:
    - functional based views
    - classed based views
    - generic views
    -Viewsets and url routing after identifying the base view
 2. We further go on to use djangorestframework to expose our end points
 3. Finally we use docker as a container for the project
 4. The next step is to use DRF with jwt for authentication and authorisation
